# Description
For now, this script updates neovim, assuming your neovim app image is named `nvim`. After applying appropriate chmod permissions, this script can be used with cron to schedule the updates.

For now this script is neovim specific, but in the future may apply to other apps that don't have automatic updates for their app images.

Dependencies: gh cli, jansson lib

Status: work in progress
